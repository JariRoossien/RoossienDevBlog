I'm Jari, a software engineer at Amazon interested in Full-stack engineering. I'll be graduating in July 2025 from the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam in Computer Science.

I've started many personal projects trying to achieve many different things, but while it's easy to start, it's difficult to complete to a full project. Yet every project I start has taught me new skills, and each new project let's me apply newly learned skills to sharpen them.

I've always had a passion for data analysis, and the interesting results you can achieve from them. It can tell us in an objective way what's going good and bad, rather than having our opinions fueled only by emotion. I have spent many hours on the dutch national bureau of statistics (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek), looking at different data, understanding the patterns, and helping me connect to the truth, not just emotions.
